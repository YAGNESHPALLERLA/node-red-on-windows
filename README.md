## Prerequisites

Before installing Node-RED, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js**: Node-RED requires Node.js to run. Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm, the Node Package Manager, which will be used to install Node-RED.

## Installation

1. Open a Command Prompt window (you can do this by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd`, and hitting `Enter`).

2. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
